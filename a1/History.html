                <strong>Overview:</strong> <br />
                
                <p>Dates back to <strong>1979</strong>
                Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as a thesis project.
                In 1983, the name of the language was changed from C with Classes to C++.
                In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was released.
                In 2005, the C++ standards committee released a technical report (dubbed TR1) 
                detailing various features they were planning to add to the latest C++ standard.
                In mid-2011, the new C++ standard (dubbed C++11) was finished.             </p>
