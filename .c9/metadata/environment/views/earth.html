According to radiometric dating and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days, a period known as an Earth sidereal year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 365.256 times.[n 6]","","Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets."],"id":8}],[{"start":{"row":11,"column":4},"end":{"row":12,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":9},{"start":{"row":12,"column":0},"end":{"row":12,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["    "]}],[{"start":{"row":11,"column":4},"end":{"row":11,"column":5},"action":"insert","lines":["<"],"id":10},{"start":{"row":11,"column":5},"end":{"row":11,"column":6},"action":"insert","lines":["i"]},{"start":{"row":11,"column":6},"end":{"row":11,"column":7},"action":"insert","lines":["m"]},{"start":{"row":11,"column":7},"end":{"row":11,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":["g"]}],[{"start":{"row":11,"column":8},"end":{"row":11,"column":9},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":11},{"start":{"row":11,"column":9},"end":{"row":11,"column":10},"action":"insert","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":11,"column":10},"end":{"row":11,"column":11},"action":"insert","lines":["r"]},{"start":{"row":11,"column":11},"end":{"row":11,"column":12},"action":"insert","lines":["c"]},{"start":{"row":11,"column":12},"end":{"row":11,"column":13},"action":"insert","lines":["="]}],[{"start":{"row":11,"column":13},"end":{"row":11,"column":15},"action":"insert","lines":["\"\""],"id":12}],[{"start":{"row":11,"column":14},"end":{"row":11,"column":145},"action":"insert","lines":["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg/220px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg"],"id":13}],[{"start":{"row":11,"column":146},"end":{"row":11,"column":147},"action":"insert","lines":[">"],"id":14}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":6,"column":10},"action":"remove","lines":["<!DOCTYPE html>","<html>","    <head>","        <title> The Solar System </title>","        <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>","    </head>","    <body>"],"id":15},{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":0,"column":37},"action":"insert","lines":["<%- include('partials/header.ejs') %>"]}],[{"start":{"row":6,"column":0},"end":{"row":7,"column":7},"action":"remove","lines":["    </body>","</html>"],"id":16},{"start":{"row":6,"column":0},"end":{"row":6,"column":37},"action":"insert","lines":["<%- include('partials/footer.ejs') %>"]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":0,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":6,"column":37},"end":{"row":6,"column":37},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":0},"timestamp":1584915679367,"hash":"bd876102a72a0301494335c076caf16dc91bda7a"}
